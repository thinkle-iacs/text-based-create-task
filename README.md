# Create Task

This is a repository for creating a simple Create Task using the text-interface library. The code goes in `main.js`.

To run this, you need to run:

```
npm run dev
```

The Text Interface library is documented here:
https://thinkle-iacs.github.io/Text-Interface-Sandbox/

Remember you will need to use `await` and `async` to use the text interface.
